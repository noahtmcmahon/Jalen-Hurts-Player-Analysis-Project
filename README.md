# Jalen-Hurts-Player-Analysis-Project

This is my first independent project in Data Analytics. Due to my love of sports, I decided it would be an interesting and challenging place to start. This project has helped me improve 
upon my skills and demonstrate some of what I know. 

## Topics Covered
1. Data Collection
2. Data Wrangling
3. EDA with Python Visualizations
4. EDA with SQL
5. Machine Learning

## Data Collection
1. Collected data from CSVs from Pro Football Reference.
2. Steps taken to collect and preprocess the raw data.

## Data Wrangling
1. Cleaned data and dealt with missing values.

## EDA with Python Visualizations
1. Detailed analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2. Visualizations and insights derived from the exploratory data analysis process.

## EDA with SQL
1. Utilization of SQL queries to further explore and analyze the data.
2. Queries used to extract relevant information and perform necessary calculations.

## Machine Learning
1. Use of multiple model types through Scikit-learn
2. Evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models.
3. Results and insights gained from the machine learning experiments.
